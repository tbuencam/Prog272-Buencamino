   "content": "The little love-god lying once asleep,\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep\nCame tripping by; but in her maiden hand\nThe fairest votary took up that fire\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warm'd;\nAnd so the general of hot desire\nWas, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from love's fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\nFor men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,\nCame there for cure and this by that I prove,\nlove's fire heats water, water cools not love."
