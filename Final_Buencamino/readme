This project includes the following features:
1. Transform and copy configurations and copy to AWS configurations are read from Mongo collections.
2. The configurations can be modified and saved back to the database from the user interface.
3. By clicking the "Fetch Sonnets" button, the user can download 35 sonnets from a "Poems" collection
   to the local folder specified. The sonnets will be stored as markdown and will be distributed into
   5 separate folders with 7 files in each.
4. Transform and copy translates the markdown to html, adding other elements from a template, and
   copies the results to a specified staging directory.
5. Using the applicable configuration, the user can publish the files the set of HTML files to the specified 
   folder on S3.
   
Notes:
In this version of the project does not include an option to load configurations into the database or add
configurations. While not difficult to do, my focus was on working out functionality that hadn't been delivered
in previous projects. This decision was made also because the application will be pointing to my MongoLab collections
which already have records that can be used or modified via the application as needed.
The database user credentials are read from the file named "databaseconfig.json" in the "Source" subdirectory of the
project.
